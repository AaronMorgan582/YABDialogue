# YABDialogue
The repository that holds the code for the dialogue functionality for the Unreal Engine game, Your Average Bear.

This is just a partial refactoring of the dialogue system that I worked on for my capstone game, Your Average Bear (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2349870/Your_Average_Bear/)

It was originally fully done in Blueprints, but I figured it would be a good lesson in C++ to refactor it. Most of the work I did on the game was with UI and Widgets, and as
I found out while refactoring, handling Widgets in C++ is a bit more cumbersome than handling them in Blueprints.

I may try to refactor all of my work done in the game into C++, but part of the difficulty is the fact that it has to interact with my teammate's work, who also worked
in Blueprints (about half of my team worked in Blueprints, and half in C++). This means I would have to refactor my work in such a manner that would encompass both
Blueprint functionality and C++ functionality, which is quite the project.

As of right now though, I would prefer to work on other games so I can expand my skillset into others areas, such as AI.
